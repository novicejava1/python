Cloud Storage
======================================================================================

- Cloud Storage is a service for storing the objects in Google cloud
- Object is a immutable piece of data consisting of file of any format
- Objects are stored in buckets. Buckets are assoicated with projects. Projects can be grouped under organization
- Tools used to interact with Cloud Storage
    Google Console
    gsutil (gcloud include gsutil)
    Client libraries for managing storage from Applications
    REST API's (ie. Managing data using JSON and XML API)
- Cloud Storage uses server-side encryption to encrypt data by default
- Object retention policy can be enabled and Object versioning
- Cloud Storage is object storage database for low latency and high durability
- Data can be configured with Object Lifecycle management OLM for transition to lower cost storage classes
- Provide multiple redundancy options
- Storage classes
    Standard Storage - Accessed frequently. Good for streaming and mobile applications
    Nearline Storage - Low cost. Good for data storage upto 30 days, eg backups and multimedia content
    Coldline Storage - Very Low cost. Good for data storage upto 90 days. eg disaster recovery
    Archive Storage - Lowest Cost, Good for data that can be stored for 365 days, regulatory archives
- Buckets are the basic containers that hold data in cloud storage
- Bucket names should be unique as they reside in single Cloud Storage namespace
- Bucket names can be used in DNS record as part of a CNAME or A redirect
- Objects stored in a multi region or dual region are geo redundant
- Storage locations should be selected to balance latency, availability and bandwidht costs for data consumers

- Storage class of existing object can be changed by rewriting the object or using Object lifecycle management
- Buckets with domain names can be created by Domain Owners
- Already created buckets cannot be renamed. New buckets needs to be created and backup and restore data into it
- Bucket object storage class can be changed. For already existing objects this change will not effect
