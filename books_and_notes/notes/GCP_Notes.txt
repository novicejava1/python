=======

Who can do what on specific resources

who - Users good account or group or service account 
what - IAM roles (create, delete, stop, start and changes - permissions are grouped to roles)
	Primitive	- Owner, Editor, viewer, billing admin
	Prdefined	- apply to particular gcp services in a project

Overview of GCP
============================================================================================================================================================

- Public cloud proivders offers services that fall into following categories
	Compute resources, Storage, Networking and specialized services such as Machine learning services

Compute Resources
	- VM's are a basic unit of computing resources
	- LB services provide service to distribute traffic to the backend VM's
	- Autoscaler add or remove VM's from cluster based on workload. This is called autoscaling
	- Autoscaling helps in managing cost and ensure sufficent compute capacity available when load increases

Managed Kubernetes Cluster
	- These are useful when focus is more on application rather than managing the cluster of servers to keep them up
	- Managed clusters make sure of Containers
	- We can specify the numbers of servers to run the containers and specify autoscaling option for each server to manage the number of containers
	- Health of the containers in managed clusters in monitored automatically and take necessary action
	- This is suitable for running application based on micro services with containers running different set of services of an application
	- Cluster management tasks take care of monitoring, networking and some security mgnt tasks

Serverless computing
	- In this developers and app administrator run their code in a computing environment that does not required setting up VM or kubernetes cluster
	- There are two options for using this service (ie. App Engine and Cloud Functions)
	- App Engine is used for applications and containers that run for extended periods of time such as website backend, point of sale system, custom business app
	- Cloud functions is a platform to run code in response to an event uploading a file and sending message into a queue

Storage
	- Types of storage services offered by GCP are (ie. Object Storage, File Storage, Block Storage and Caches)

	- Object storage is a system that manages the use of storage in terms of objects and blobs
	- Objects are grouped into buckets and individually addressable by URL
	- It is serverless and does not need an VM or attached storage required
	- GCP Cloud storage is accessible from servers running in GCP and as well other devices with internet access

	- File storage service provides hierarchical storage system for files
	- GCP has file storage service called Cloud FileStore which is based on NFS storage system
	- File system storage decouples the file system from specific VM's
	- It is suitable for applicaiton that require OS like file access to files

	- Block storage uses fixed size data structure called block to organize the data
	- Its used in ephemeral and persistent disk attached to VM's 
	- File systems can be installed and applications can run on the block storage directly
	- Relational DB often write directly to blocks in size of 8KB
	- Block storage is available on disks that are attached to VM's 
	- Persistent block storage store data even when they are detached from the VM or VM is shutdown
	- Ephemeral disk exist and store store data as long as the VM is running
	- Object storage does not support OS or filesystem level access
	- Object storage store large volumes of data that are copied to persistent disks when needed
	
	- Caches are in memory data stores that maintain fast access to data
	- The latency of in memory stores is designated to be in sub milli seconds
	- Caches are helpful to keep read latency to a minimum for the application
	- Caches are volatile. Data is lost when the machine reboots or shutdowns
	- Cache data invalidation and keeping the data in cache in sync with the SSD or HDD for system of truth is very critical desigin issue

Networking
	- Each NW accessible device or service in environment will need an IP address
	- GCP can have both internal and external addresses
	- Internal address are accessbile only to servies in internal GCP network
	- Internal GCP network is defined as VPC
	- External address are accessible from internet
	- IP address can be static (which are assigned for extended period of time) and ephemeral (assigned until the lifecyle of the VM)
	- Firewall rules define which services on which protocol and port are allowed to be accessed from which IP address (maintain source and destination communicaiton rules)
	- VPC and On premises data centers can communicate using the network peering (ie. distinct network linking)

Specialized Services -
	- There are some specialized services each cloud service provider provides which can be further used in the applicaiton flow for data processing
	- AutoML a machine learning service
	- Cloud Natural language for analyzing text
	- Cloud vision for analyzing images
	- Cloud interface API for computing correlation over time - series data

Benefits of Cloud Computing
	- Renting the resources whenever required and pay for it as per the usage
	- Provides Pay as you use model
	- Elastic resource allocation
	- Cloud providers design the data centers with extensive compute, storage and network resources
	- Specialized services

Google Cloud computing services
============================================================================================================================================================

- All the GCP resources are organized and linked to billing system
- GCP organizational hierarchy consists of organizations, folders, and projects
- GCP provides a way to group resources and manage them as a single unit. This is called resource hierarchy
- The access to resources in resource hierarchy is controlled by a set of policies that you can define
- Organization is the root level resource hierarchy corresponding to an organization or company
- Organization can be created in two ways
	Already existing G suite customers can create organization in GCP
	Google Identity as a service can be used to create organization
- Cloud identity have super admins, and those super admins assign IAM role to users who manage the organization
- GCP will automatically grant project creator and billing account creator IAM roles to all users in the domain
- Users with Org Admin IAM role are responsible for below
	Define structure of resource hierarchy
	Define IAM policies over the resource hierarchy
	Delegating other management roles to other users
- When a billing account or project is created GCP will automatically create an organization  resource

- Folders are building blocks of multilayer org hierarchy. Folders can contain other folders and projects
- Folders help in segregating departments and their corresponding roles

- Project is the important part of the org hierarchy. This is where all the GCP resources created, GCP services used, manage permissions and manage billing options
- resourcemanager.projects.create IAM permission can create a project

- GCP organization policy service controls access to an organizaiton resources. The organization policy service complements the IAM service
- IAM service lets you assign permissions so users or roles can perform specific operations in the cloud
- Org policy service lets to specify limists on the ways resources can be used
- Org policy are defined in terms of constraints on a resource
- Constraints are restrictions on services. GCP has two types of constraints list constraints and boolean constraints
- Policies are inherited and cannot be disabled or overridden by objects lower in the hierarchy
- Multiple policies can be in effect for folder or project

- Role is a collection of permissions. Roles are granted to users by binding user to a role
- Thre are three types of roles in GCP
	Primitive roles includes Owner, Editor, Viewer
	Predefined roles (Recommended for fine grained access control - principle of least privilege)
	Custom roles
- Permissions cannot be assigned to users, they can be assigned only to roles
- Roles are assigned to users

- Identities are usually associated with individual users.
- Applications can be provided the required roles so they can perform opertions on behalf of users
- Service accounts can be created and assigned to applications so they can perform the required operations like connecting to db
- There are two types of service accounts 
	user managed service accounts
	google managed service accounts
- Google managed service accounts are used by various GCP services internally
- Service accounts can be managed as a group of accounts at the project level or at the individual service account level
- Service accounts are created automatically when resources created. But they can also be created manually using IAM for application purpose

- GCP Billing API provides a way to manage how we pay for resources used
- Billing accounts store information about to pay charges for resources used
- Billing account is associated with one or more projects
- There are two types of billing accounts
	Selfserve - pay using credit / debit card automatically
	invoiced - Invoices are sent to customers usually used by large org
- Billing Roles
	Billing account creator		- used to create accounts
	Billing account administrator	- used to manage existing accounts
	Billing account user		- used to link projects
	Billing account viewer		- used to view bills and transactions
- Billing service allows to set the budget and billing alerts for a billing account
- Billing data can be exported to either a Bigquery database or Cloud storage file for analysis and compliance reasons
- Billing data exported to cloud storage file can be saved in JSON or CSV file format

- GCP uses API's to make services programmatically accessbile
- All GCP services have API associated with them

- Stackdriver is a set of services for monitoring, logging, tracing and debugging applications and resources
- For monitoring and logging data to be saved into stackdriver you need to create workspace to save it

============================================================================================================================================================
Introduction to Computing in GCP
============================================================================================================================================================

- Compute engine is a serivce that provide VM's that run in GCP
- Instances run images which contain OS, libraries and other code
- Snapshots can be created from boot disk which can be further used as image for other VM's
- Custom images from on prem data centers can be imported using the virtual disk import tool provided by google
- Virtual machines are contained in projects
- Virtual machines run in a zone and region
- Zones are data center like resources that are closed coupled. Zones are located within regions
- Zones within a region are linked by low-latency, high bandwidth network connections
- Users need privileges to create vm
- Users or identities are assigned a role which provides a set of permissions on a particular resource
	Compute engine admin - Full control
	Compute engine network admin - Full control on networking resources
	Compute engine security admin - Full control on Firewall and SSL management
	Compute engine viewer - list the resources
- IAM policies can be used to grant permissions directly to resources
- Preemptive VM's are suitable for machines which are fault tolerant applications like big data analysis, rendering apps. They persist for upto 24 hours.
- Preemptive VM's if terminated within 10 min are not charged
- These machines cannot be migrated to regular VM and cannot be set to auto restart
- VM's can be grouped called instance groups. It helps in manage similar vm's as a single unit

- App Engine is a PaaS service that provides managed platform for running applications
- App Engine users concentrate mode on code and there is less to manage on the resources and less control on the resources that are used to execute the app
- Applications in App Engine are created within a project
- App Engine applications have common structure they consist of services and services can have multiple versions that can run on instances
- Each version of service runs on a instanced managed by App Engine
- App Engine provides autoscaling based on the demand by creating dynamic instances
- App Engine provides resident instances that run continually
- GCP allows to set daily spending limit and create budgets for a specific project to spend

- App Engine provides two types of runtime environment Standard and Flexible
- App Engine standard environment consists of a preconfigured language specific runtime
- App Engine Flexible environment provides more options and control to developers on the PaaS environment
- App Engine Flexible environment uses containers as the basic building block
- App Engine Flexible environment is good options if we can package our application into small set of containers. These containers can then be autoscaled based on load
- App Engine is fully managed PaaS. Health of App Engine servers is monitored by Google
- In case on Kubernetes Engine, the clusters need to be monitored using the tools such as Stackdriver for monitoring and autoscaling 
- App Engine standard environment scales down to no running instances if there is no load, but this is not the case with the fl exible environment.
- App Engine standard environment is suitable for applications written in one of the supported languages
- App Engine is one of the serverless option

- Kubernetes engine can be used in applications which divided into various services but need to be managed as single resource
- Kubernetes engine is GCP managed Kubernetes service
	Create cluster of VM's
	Deploy containerized apps to cluster
	Administer the cluster
	Specify policies like autoscaling and resource management
	Montior cluster health
- Kubernetes is designed to support clusters that run a variety of applications
- Kubernetes cluster consist of master and worked nodes
- Master node manages the cluster services like API server, controller, schedulers.
- Master determines what containers and workloads run on each node
- Kubernetes deploys containers in groups called pods. Containers within a single pod share storage and network resources
- Contianers within a pod share an IP address and port space
- Kubernetes supports something called eviction policies that set thresholds for resources
- Kubernetes shutsdown pods that become starved for resources
- A group of running identical pods is called a deployment. The identical pods are called replicas
- Kubernetes deployment can be in three states
	Progressing, Completed or Failed
- Kubernetes is good choice for large scale applications that required HA and High reliability

- Cloud Functions is a serverless computing platform designed to run single piece of code in response to events in GCP environments
- Cloud Functions provides a glue between services that are otherwise independent
- GCP manages everything needed to execute Cloud functions code in a secure and isolated environment
- Cloud functions may be running in multiple instances at one time
- Cloud functions are suitable for event based processing applications like IoT, asyn workflows and mobile applications

============================================================================================================================================================
Computing with Compute Engine Virtual Machines
============================================================================================================================================================

- Compute engine VM can be created using three ways
	Google cloud console
	Google cloud sdk
	Google cloud shell

- Management, Security, Disks and Networking and Sole Tenancy are other details that can further be edited while creating the VM
- Management tab helps in describing and adding key value pair labels to the VM. These are helpful when the infra is expanding to manage
- You can add startup script and shutdown script to run respectively once the VM is started and before its stopped to do clean up
- The meta data values are stored in metadata server and are available for querying using the Compute engine API
- In Security tab we can specify if we want to use shielded vms and secure ssh keys
- Sheilded VM's are configured with additional security mechanisms
	Secure boot - Digitally signed OS are allowed to boot
	Virtual trusted platform module vTPM - TPM is a specialized computer chip designed to protect security resources, like keys are certs
	Integrity monitoring - uses to know good baseline of boot measurements
- By default Google manages the encryption keys for the boot disk
- GCP supports the concept of project wide ssh keys which gives users project wide access to VM's
- Using existing disk in read only mode is good way of replicating reference data across multiple instances
- In networking setting we can add multiple network interfaces
- If we need to ensure that VM's run on server only with other Vm's then we can specify sole tenancy

- The gcloud command is organized into a hierarchy of groups
	gcloud compute instances create
- VM's can also be created using the cloud shell

============================================================================================================================================================
Managing Virtual Machines
============================================================================================================================================================

- A group of VM's that run the same configuraiton are called instance groups
- The content of memory is lost when the VM is restarted. If data needs to be preserved you need to store in persistent disk or cloud storage
- GPU are used for math intensive applications such as visualization and machine learning
- To add a GPU to an instance, you must start an instance in which GPU libraries are installed or will be installed
- We also need to make sure that the instance runs in a zone that has GPU available
- GPU cannot be attached to shared memory libraries
- When a GPU is added to a VM we must set the instance to terminate during maintenance

- Snapshots are copies of data on persistent disk
- Its is always recommended to Flush the disk before we take snapshot of it. The first snapshot of the disk is full backup and other snapshots are incremental only
- To work with snapshots the user must have Compute Storage Admin role

- Images are similar to snapshots in that they are copies of disk contents
- Images are used to create VM's. Snapshots are used to make data available on a disk
- Images can be created from 
	Disk
	Snapshots
	Cloud storage file
	Another image
- You can delete and deprecate only custom images, not GCP-supplied images.
- Google’s deprecated images are available for use but may not be patched for security flaws or other updates.
- Management of VM instances and images can be done using Cloud shell and also Cloud SDK

- Instance groups are a set of VM's that are managed as a single entity
- gcloud command applied to an insatance group is applied to all members of the instance group
- There are two types of instance groups - managed and unmanaged
	Managed group - identical configuration, auto scaling, auto healing, creating using instance template
	Unmanaged group - not identical and having different configuration
- Instance groups are created from Instance group templates
- Instance groups can contain instances in a single zone or across region
- Regional managed instance groups are recommended because they spread workload across zones and increase resiliency
- Use managed instance groups to enable autoscaling and load balancing.

============================================================================================================================================================
Computing with Kubernetes
============================================================================================================================================================

- Kubernetes engine is GCP managed Kubernetes service
- Kubernetes runs containers on a cluster of virtual machines
- Kubernetes does the following which are called container orchestration tasks
	identifies where to run the container
	montior the health of container
	manage full lifecycle of the VM instances
- Kubernetes cluster consist of master and nodes
- The cluster master manages services provided by kubernetes such as API, Controller, Scheduler
- User can interact with cluster using the kubectl command
- The nodes run an agent called kubelet which is the service that communicates with the cluster master
- Some memory and cpu is reserved for kubernetes and so is not available to applications running on the nodes
- There are several organizing objects that make up the core functionality of how kubernetes process workloads
- Kubernetes objects - Workloads are distributed across nodes in a kubernetes cluster. Each of the below object contributes to logical organizing of workloads
	Pods
	Services
	Volumes
	Namespaces
- Pods are single instances of running process in cluster. There can be atleast container or multiple containers in a pod for an applicaiton
- Replicas are copies of pods and constitute a group of pods that are managed as a unit
- Pods are ephemeral, they are expected to termiate
- The mechanism that manages scaling and health of cluster is known as controller
- Service is an object that provides API endpoints with a stable IP address that allows applications to discover pods running a particular application
- Replicaset is a controller used by deployment that ensures that correct number of identical pods are running
- Deployments are set of identical pods. A pod template is a definition of how to run a pod
- StatefulSets are like deployments but they are assigned a unique identifier to pods. This enables kubernetes to track which pod is used by which client and keep 
them together
- StatefulSets are used when an application needs a unique network identifier or stable persistent storage.
- Jobs create pods and run them until the application completes a workload.

- Kubernetes cluster can deployed using console, cloud sdk or CLI
- To use kubernetes engine first we need to enable the kubernetes engine API
- Credentials need to be created when we use Kubernetes engine for the first time
- There are different types of clusters that can be created based on the application requirement
- Node pools are instance groups in kubernetes cluster
- Kubernetes runs a number of workloads to manage the cluster

- The basic command for working with kubernetes engine is the following gcloud command
	gcloud beta container
- Deployment yaml file can be further used for creating other deployments
- To work with kubernetes cluster using command line we will need cloud SDK and kubernetes cli tools kubectl
	gcloud components install kubectl
- Stackdriver can be used to monitor the kubernetes cluster
- Stackdriver workspaces are resources for monitoring and can support upto 100 monitored projects
- Workspace contains dashboards, alerting policies, group definitions and notification checks
